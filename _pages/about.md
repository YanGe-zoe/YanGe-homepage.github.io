    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
      Using droplet microfluidics as a carrier, a highly efficient and stable Raman flow cytometry platform is established by optimizing the coupling between the droplet microfluidic system and the line-shaped laser beam, achieving a single-cell live detection accuracy of ‚â• 90% and a sorting throughput of ‚â• 200 cells/h.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Methods: This study explores the adaptability and sensitivity differences of different optical detection methods (e.g., Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging, light scattering) in microscale environments, thereby constructing a high-throughput, high-sensitivity microfluidic optical detection platform.
