To address the issues of low accuracy and large sample consumption in traditional biopharmaceutical viscosity measurement techniques, this thesis proposes a novel microfluidic viscosity detection system that enables high-precision, low-sample-consumption, and cost-effective viscosity measurement.
The main innovative work and achievements of this thesis are as follows:
1.	A variable cross-section microfluidic chip design was proposed. Using photocuring 3D printing technology, a layered fabrication method for the microfluidic chip was developed, overcoming the limitations of traditional constant cross-section designs that rely on microscopic equipment and suffer from low measurement accuracy.
2.	A high-throughput viscosity measurement system based on the microfluidic chip was designed. By connecting multiple gas channels to a chip holder, parallel multi-channel measurements were realized, significantly improving detection efficiency.

  Viscosity, as a crucial property of liquids, plays a vital role in various fields, including food, chemical, pharmaceutical, personal care, and biomedicine. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop methods that can accurately measure the viscosity of liquids in various environments. To this end, researchers have developed a variety of viscosity measurement techniques. In view of the complexity of viscosity measurement, viscosity measurement in many cases depends on optical technology. Optical-based viscosity measurement technology has demonstrated excellent performance at both macro and micro levels because of its suitability for low sample volumes and the advantages of non-contact measurement. Besides, it can be easily combined with other technologies and is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios.
